## SWBATs

Take what they learned in Mods 1 through 4 and use them as examples to explain these concepts in programming:

- [ ] message passing
- [ ] abstraction
- [ ] layers
- [ ] APIs

## Lecture Overview

[**Message Passing**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing) per Wikipedia:

> message passing is a technique for invoking behavior (i.e., running a program) on a computer. The invoking program sends a message to a process (which may be an actor or object) and relies on the process and the supporting infrastructure to select and invoke the actual code to run. Message passing differs from conventional programming where a process, subroutine, or function is directly invoked by name.

1. Message passing is a technique for invoking behavior (i.e., running a program) on a computer.
  - Message passing is a technique for getting the computer to do something.
2. The invoking program sends a message to a process (which may be an actor or object) and relies on the process and the supporting infrastructure to select and invoke the actual code to run.
  - Send a message to X, trusts that X will do what it's told to do.
3. Message passing differs from conventional programming where a process, subroutine, or function is directly invoked by name.
  - No separate methods. Just one method to rule them all.

### Student Exercise

```ruby
# TODO
```

```javascript
// TODO
```

### Summary

Everything boils down to:

* message passing
  * ruby run.rb, rails s, npm start
  * OOP => `.send()`
  * request <---> response
  * fetch
  * setState
* abstraction
  * helper methods
  * OOP => inheritance
  * factory pattern
  * higher order functions
  * higher order components
* layers
  * OOP => encapsulation
  * ORM
  * MVC
  * DOM
  * Components
* APIs
  * class & instance methods
  * RESTful routes
  * JS & the DOM
  * Adapter Pattern
