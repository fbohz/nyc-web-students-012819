Intro to Object Orientation
===========================

aka: Object Oriented Programming (OOP)


## Lecture Notes

# What is an object

data
point where data is stored
'encapsulates state'

behavior
what a thing can do
'encapsulates behavior'

data + behavior together in one object

player = {
  player_name: "Alan Anderson",
  number: 0,
  shoe: 16,
  points: 22,
  rebounds: 12,
  assists: 12,
  steals: 3,
  blocks: 1,
  slam_dunks: 1
}

## Exercise

Here is a naive implementation of a bank account in Ruby using only a hash which stores key-value pairs.

```ruby
bank_account = {"user_id": 3, "balance": 100}
```

Write an implementation of a bank account that meets the following requirements:

* can print the balance of the account
* can deposit money into the account
* can withdraw money from the account
* keeps track of the account number
* keeps track of the customer id of the account

- Object can have slightly different meanings in different languages. Pythonâ€™s is a looser definition than that of Ruby. However, in the end, the concept is the same even if the execution and implementation details exposing objects is different.

> A **class** is a blueprint which you use to create **objects**. An **object** is an **instance** of a class. The **object** is a _concrete thing_ while **instance** indicates the relationship of an **object** _to_ its **class**.

- Classes = blueprints
- Objects = things
- Instances = can you fill in the blank? what do they describe? what are they? why are they important?
