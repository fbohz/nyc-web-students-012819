# SWBATs
* Distinguish between synchronous and asynchronous code
* Correctly predict the order code will execute in when using async flows (which console.log will happen first)
* Recognize code that uses `Promises`
* Fire off an AJAX request in response to a user event
* Use the `.then` method to add handlers for promise resolution; append newly fetched data to the DOM
* Use the options to `fetch()` to configure HTTP requests
